# Source API
This is a kind of "framework" to develop console apps with C#.

## Getting Started
In the template project, there are 4 projects, `API`, `App`, `Logger` and `Compiler`, this is because now you can modify the engine to suit your needs.\
The `API` project contains all the classes and logic behind the engine functionality.\
The `App` project its your app's logic, and you can add as many projects as you want. This one by default contains a file called `SourceConfig.json`.\
The `Logger`project contains all the functionality for the Source Logger.\
The `Compiler` project its in charge to create the release build of the final app.
